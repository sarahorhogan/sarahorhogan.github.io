        Hey claire,
        Thanks for always cracking me up! When you wanted to do the hoodie dance, when you always walk the opposite pathway from the rest of us and disappear,
        your instagram pics  and when you thought 变态 meant changing attitude and you told your friend that he 变态!!
        Hahaha. Wish you all the best for your clinical placements and everything else! Happy birthdayyyy!!

        3 years back we were just young clueless kids flashing our white med coats, acting all cool and not knowing what we actually got 
        ourselves into and now we’re less than a year away from becoming working adults. Thank u for the colours that u add to my uni life 
        from celebrating end of exams and birthdays to being project mates. More importantly, thank u for being an amazing friend that i can count on!❤️ Continue to rely on God for wisdom and strength to navigate adulting and let’s catch up when we can alright!!

        Really glad to have known you through PHYSIO!  Also, thanks for being my practical partner!  
        Those long hours we spent in the lab practising for prac exams and clinicals! 
        Can’t forget the day when you attempted to learn the cat cow pose so that you can teach your patients. 
        HAHA! Anyway, good to see you around CGH at times during placement. Jiayous to us for the next 2 weeks! 🙂 
        WE CAN DO IT! Am indeed really blessed to have you as a friend! Continue to be a blessing to the people around you Claire!

        Wish we could meet up to celebrate, but hopefully we can once you're done with your placements etc :) 
        I can't believe we're coming up on 10 years of knowing each other, it seems like yesterday 
        that we were still semi-awkward sec 1 kids hahaha
        Anyway, I just wanted to say that I really admire how dedicated you are to your work and your studies - 
        it blows my mind how compassionate and caring you are in what I'm sure is a very difficult profession. 
        I really hope that you'll achieve everything you're aiming for! 
        You definitely deserve it! So yeah, all the best for work and school and hopefully we'll get to catch up soon :)
